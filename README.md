## Hi there 👋

I am a PhD candidate in Business Analytics at the University of Cincinnati. My research is centered on the development of statistical methods for categorical and discrete data to improve model interpretation, inference, and evaluation. My current work focuses on developing finite-sample inference techniques and measures of model adequacy for generalized linear models, with applications in healthcare and financial settings.
